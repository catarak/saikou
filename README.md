# Saikou

Saikou [saikō] means "the greatest" in Japanese. We wanted to bring together all songs that were, at one point or another, the greatest, from all over the world. We scraped international music chart data and put it all in one place, an API we created called [Saikou-API](https://github.com/catarak/saikou-api/). This application contains a visualization interacting with the aforementioned API. A user can see which songs were popular around the world at any time in recent history, such as the week of June 15th in 1985. See it live at [https://saikou.herokuapp.com](https://saikou.herokuapp.com).
