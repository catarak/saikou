# Saikou

This application contains a visualization interacting with music chart data from around the world. A user can see which songs were popular around the world at, say, the week of June 15th in 1985. See it live at https://saikou.herokuapp.com.

Saikou features an accompanying API, called [Saikou-API](https://github.com/catarak/saikou-api/), created as part of this project. You can use it by reading the documentation over at its Github page.
